## intro
this repo contains branches for each test I made. I made a test for securing Orthanc with Postgres and Mariadb. I failed to encrypt Postgres (maybe can be done) but encrypting Mariadb was easy enough (using TDE).

Another test that needs to be done is securing orthanc by encrypting the docker volume on which it is mount.
